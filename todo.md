- to raidal inside 
- adjust seam area to generating result
- pattern rotate matching
    - 90, 180, 270, <->
    
- seam processing in gpu
- heuristic approach to find pattern
- seam curving
- contrast before find edge
- adjust brightness

- if pattern scale is large, it would be overlap area is large, 
  if pattern sclae is small, it would be overlap area is small
  or
  fix zigzag when overlap area is large
